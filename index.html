                            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
                            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
